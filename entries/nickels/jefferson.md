## Description

The Jefferson nickel was minted from 1938 to 2003 (with variants minted after that). It depicts Thomas Jefferson on the obverse and his home of Monticello on the reverse.

## History

The Jefferson nickel was first minted in 1938 with the mint mark being on the bottom right of Monticello. In part of 1942 to 1945 the mint mark was moved to above the dome of Monticello indicating that it is a "war nickel". This means it is made of 35% silver. This includes a "P" mintmark for the Philadelphia mint, the first US coin to have a P mint mark.

## Fun Facts

- This was the first 5 cent coin in the US to have a president on the coin. 
- The Jefferson nickel was the first coin to have a "P" mint mark for the Philadelphia mint. This happened from 1942-1945 during World War 2.
