## How to report a bug

Open an issue with the `bug report` template and fill in everything it asks for. This includes an operating system, browser, etc.

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement
If you have an idea for a feature open an issue with the feature request template or a PR adding the code for the feature. Before you do either of those things make sure the feature is not on our [roadmap](https://trello.com/b/TtsJmfVY/road-map).

## Code review process
### Explain how a contribution gets accepted after it’s been submitted.
The reviews that will review your issue or PR are:

[@ethan-master-coding](https://github.com/ethan-master-coding)


When you submit an issue for PR check-in daily it's better the more often you can check in. This is because the reviews will probably suggest changes to improve it before it we merge it.

# Community
If you would like to discuss the site you can with [GH discussion](https://github.com/How-To-Program-Org/How-To-Program/discussions) or our [discord](https://discord.gg/qPXPdVVQfE).

## Explain if you use any labeling conventions for issues.

## How we live
We have quite a few different labels. This is what they are:

1. `bug`: A bug

2. `enhancement`: New feature or request

3. `Waiting on OP`: Waiting on the OP (original poster) to respond either accepting or denying suggestions.

4. `wont fix`: This will not be worked on

5. `New coin`: This deals with adding a new coin.

6. `Penny`, `Nickle`, `Dime`, `Quarter`, `Half $`, ` Dollar` and `Other`: These lables are for issues and PRs that deal with adding new coins.
